# Steam_Top_10
Steam sales top 10

A small project making use of BeatifullSoup and Selenium to scrape the steam website for the top 10 sold games at that moment. I used Selenium to fill in a google form with the data extracted from the Steam website.

This project was as a practice to ehance my webscraping and Selenium skills.
